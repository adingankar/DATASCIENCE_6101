# PROJECT 2 - Project Proposal on Telecom Industry Customer Churn Prediction

One of the most important goals of any telecommunication business is to maximize the number of customers. To achieve this, it is important not only to try to attract new customers but also to retain existing ones. Also, retaining old customers costs less than attracting new customers. By predicting the customer churn, the business can react in time and try to keep the customers who are most likely to leave. The business can do so by making special offers to such customers in order to retain them.
